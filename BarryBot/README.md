The goal of this project is to create a conversational machine learning model that can assist ontologists who need help modeling domains. To that end, I am attempting to train several kinds of LLM models with different training strategies.
This directory holds all of my work in this project, including the training data, much of which will be texts he has written (alone or in collaboration with others) and some of his own question-and-answering data provided just for this project.
